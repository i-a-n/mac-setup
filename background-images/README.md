# ðŸ–¥ Background Images
Highly-optimized, precision-crafted workspace visuals for four different spaces.

â€¦Whatever, theyâ€™re just stupid color-coded PNGs.

## The usual setup
Color-coded workspaces help me mentally compartmentalize my tools. I create four Mac spaces, and set the backgrounds to each of the different files included in this directory. Here are my four standard spaces, and their related themes:

### Space #1, _Terminal and Hacking_
Space one is colored *orange*. Apps include:

- Terminal
- Atom / Code editor
- Git GUI

### Space #2, _Browsing and Chat_
Space two is colored *blue*. Apps include:

- Browser / Developer tools pane
- Chat windows

### Space #3, _Administrative Stuff_
Space three is colored *green*. Apps include:

- Mail
- Calendar
- Finder windows
- Settings
- Activity Monitor
- Text files

### Space #4, _Design_
Space four is *grayscale*. Apps include:

- Photoshop
- Illustrator
- Font book
- Digital Color Meter

## Extra credit
These images are colorized and lightly edited versions of [an engraving](http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/154053.html) of [Possession Bay, South Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_Bay), likely created from accounts of Captain James Cookâ€™s second voyage to the Antarctic Sea. They are in the public domain.
