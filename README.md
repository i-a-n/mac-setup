This is a collection of scripts and reference points for my personal OS X setup. Feel free to use. Here‚Äôs a summary of each tool:

* * *

### üìÇ 21-day-bin
Instructions and a shell script for creating a folder that auto-deletes files in it that are older than 21 days. Useful for storing screenshots and other temp files.

### üìÇ background-images
My personal color-coded background images. Four of them: one per each workspace.

### üìÇ copy-filename-as-repo-url
This lets you right-click on an image file in Finder, and automatically copy it to your clipboard as it would appear in a URL for an image in my repo. Useful as a kind of personalized ‚ÄúGet Dropbox URL‚Äù.

### üìÇ screenshot-downscaling
Adds a shortcut for screenshotting: Saves the original size, and a half-size, to a folder on the desktop. Useful because retina-sized-screenshots are way too big.

### üóí APPS.md
A tabular list of the most useful software for priming a new Mac for web development. Also includes descriptions, prices, and a logical dock order for them.

### üóí README.md
This very README file
